# Bedrock

Front-end boilerplate for use with [Codekit 2](http://incident57.com/codekit).


## Seriously? Another boilerplate?

It's not for you, it's for me. I'm just sharing it because... well, because that's how we move the web forward.


## Why Codekit?

Because [@bdkjones](https://github.com/bdkjones) built a really kick-ass tool. I've played with a handful of different workflows, but nothing quite rivals the breadth of what Codekit can do, and the speed with which it can do it. Until I find something better, that's what Bedrock will work with.


## What's inside?

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io)
- [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org)
- [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org)
- [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)
- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com)
- [D3JS](http://d3js.org)


## How do I get this thing off the ground?

Download the zip file, unzip it, and drag the folder in to Codekit 2. Rename your project. Consider checking for the most recent version of the included libraries. Go forth and build.
