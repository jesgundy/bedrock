# Bedrock

Front-end boilerplate for use with [Codekit 2](http://incident57.com/codekit).


## Seriously? Another boilerplate?

Yup. It's not for you, it's for me. I'm just sharing it because... well, because that's how we move the web forward.


## Why Codekit?

Because [@bdkjones](https://github.com/bdkjones) built a really kick-ass tool. I've played with a handful of different workflows, but nothing quite rivals the breadth of what Codekit can do, and the speed with which it can do it. Until I find something better, that's what Bedrock will work with.


## What's inside?

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io)
- [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org)
- [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org)
- [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)
- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com)
- [D3JS](http://d3js.org)


## How do I get this thing off the ground?

Download the zip file, and drag it in to Codekit 2. Consider checking for the most recent version of the included libraries. Fin.
